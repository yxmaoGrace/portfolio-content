		<p>One magic thing about spiciness is that it is the key ingredient of many famous and beloved dishes 
			around the world. The list below displays some dishes liked by spicy lovers worldwide.</p>

		<p>Salsas
			Origin: Mexico
			Type of food: Condiment
			Spicy ingredient: many types of chilies, including Jalapenos
			Fun fact: Mexico’s biggest spicy export and its favorite condiment, salsas are a world unto themselves. 
			The varieties are endless, but the base of chillies, fresh herbs, and red or green tomatoes is ubiquitous. 
			While visitors to Mexico wanted to nail down a guideline as to which salsa is hotter, red or green, 
			any seasoned taco-eater will tell you that either could be blazing hot or surprisingly mild. 
			While the creamy avocado green sauce served at many taco stands tends to be a little less intense, 
			it could easily blow your socks off. Often, salsa with chile de árbol or habanero peppers will be extra-hot.</p>

		<p>Tom Yum
			Origin: Thailand
			Type of food: Soup
			Spicy ingredient: Crushed chilli peppers
			Fun fact: It’s one of the most popular Thai dishes across the globe
			Although this hot and sour shrimp soup originates from Central Thailand, 
			it can also be found in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar, Singapore or Laos. 
			If you’re looking for a partner to follow this spicy soup, make sure you team it up 
			with a pad thai or pad see ew (a mild noodle dish if you can’t handle the heat).</p>

		<p>Kimchi-jjigae (kimchi soup)
			Origin: South Korea
			Type of food: Stew
			Spicy ingredient: Kimchi and chilli peppers
			Fun fact: It takes between one and three months to make a Korean-style kimchi
			You might not expect South Korea to harbour some of the spiciest dishes in the world, but it does. 
			If you’re looking for a unique gastronomy jaunt, South Korea should be next on your go-to list. 
			The street markets are out of this world and Seoul is unquestionably foodie hub.</p>

		<p>Sik Sik Wat
			Origin: Ethiopia
			Type of food: Stew
			Spicy ingredient: Berbere, an Ethiopian spice mixture
			Fun fact: Berbere is basically added to everything in Ethiopia
			If you’re looking to shock your tastebuds, this is the dish for you. 
			In Ethiopia, the distinct cultural heritage is evident in the rich, 
			diverse flavours of each dish. Sik Sik Wat is essentially hearty 
			(not to mention SPICY) stew made up of a few sauces combined with meat or vegetables.
